# Object-Oriented-Programming-Final-Project
Refactored 2D "game" (java):
  - Final project for my project based Object Oriented Programing class
  - took a poorly coded virtual world, refactored it into OOP style, built off of previous renditions worked on throughout the quarter
  - added an entity implementing the a-star pathing algorithm, including sprites
